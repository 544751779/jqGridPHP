jqGridPHP is a 
This project is intended to save tons of time for PHP developers jqGrid.

It is inspired by Tony Tomov and his great jQuery Grid Plugin!
Check it here: https://github.com/tonytomov/jqGrid

The project consists of two parts:

= jqGrid Backend PHP Library

The library allows you to create full functional grids with only few lines of code.

It provides server side support for the most of jqGrid features:

- Dynamic grid rendering (HTML & JS)
- JSON data output
- Pagination
- Sorting
- Toolbar search
- Add, Edit, Delete and custom operations
- TreeGrid
- Export to Excel

All these functions are implemented in one PHP class. It meant to be extended using PHP inheritance feature.
You may alter almost any aspect of grid functionality and integrate it into your application.

It is possible to work with any data source. Not only database.
It is possible to add your custom code before or after ANY of the common functions, or replace them entirely with anything you need.

= jqGrid Extension Function

Additional JS and CSS files working in conjunction with PHP-lib.

They make grids to look better and implements the following features:

- Per-row and per-cell color highlighting (adds your classes to rows and cells)
- Easy Form editing server-side validation (just throw an exception anywhere during the editing process)
- Easy Summary row
- Additional predefined formatters with placeholders (you can format one column based on values from other columns)
- Real selection preserve (the native one is little buggy)
- Right-click menu

These functions DOES NOT modify the jqGrid core script in any way.
You dont need the special forks of jqGrid, so it is possible to upgrade jqGrid any time you want.

= Documentation & Live demo

Coming soon..

= Requirements & dependencies

The script requires PHP 5.3.
It also use PDO as default database driver, but you can replace it with your own data wrapper.
